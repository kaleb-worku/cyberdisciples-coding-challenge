# cyberdisciples-coding-challenge
I learned the Rust programming language and with the assistance of generative AI, I created a program that prints a static image to the screen with a verse from the New International Version translation of the Bible. This coding challenge is part of my affiliation with the Cyber Disciples small group at Stevens Creek Church.
