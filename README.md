# cyber-disciples-coding-challenge-apr-2025
In April 2025, I learned the Rust programming language and, with the assistance of generative AI, created a program in Rust (main.rs) that prints a static image (background.jpg) to the screen with a verse from the New International Version translation of the Bible in the center of the image (output_with_verse.png). This coding challenge is part of my affiliation with the Cyber Disciples small group at Stevens Creek Church.
